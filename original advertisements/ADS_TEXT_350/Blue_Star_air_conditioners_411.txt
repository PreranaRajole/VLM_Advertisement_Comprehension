DID YOU KNOW THAT MICRO PARTICLES OF CEMENT, STONE AND CONCRETE TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO ENTER YOUR HOUSE AND SETTLE DEEP INSIDE YOUR LUNGS?

The air outside blows dust and chemicals from construction sites into your house. And once inside, they are trapped by the four walls. Which is why the air in your house is at least 10 times more polluted than the air outside. Over time, the air becomes a deadly cocktail of trillions of dust mites, bacteria and viruses, smoke, cleaning agent fumes and many other pollutants. Happily for you, there is the new Blue Star Air Purifier. Its SensAir technology removes 99.7% of these pollutants* to make the air in your house clean and healthy.
