EVER WONDER IF CALIFORNIA IS THE WORLD'S BEST PLACE FOR GROWING AVOCADOS?

People are always asking, what makes California Avocados so special, and our answer is just three simple words... location, location, location. California has one of the best growing climates in the world. And within this beautiful state, there are only a few prime growing regions where the soil is rich with nutrients, calm coastal breezes waft through the lush, fruit-bearing trees, and the sunshine is gentle and just right.

In fact, less than one percent of California is used for growing avocados, because we only grow 'em where they grow best. Our family farmers take great pride in this fertile land, because they know that only these precious plots of land can bring that creamy, completely hand-crafted California Avocado taste to your table. So the next time you're in the produce department, be sure to look for California on the label.
