The carpool lane just got a nice big whiff of smelling salts.

Nothing invigorates the routine of a daily commute like a sports car. 
Introducing the new Porsche Macan Turbo, a 400-horsepower twin-turbo V6, that achieves 0-60 in 4.6 seconds. With standard PDK double-clutch transmission and active all-wheel drive for maximum grip in varying driving conditions. The Macan Turbo is the latest manifestation of the Porsche philosophy that every car should be a sports car. And every drive should be unforgettable. Porsche. There is no substitute.
