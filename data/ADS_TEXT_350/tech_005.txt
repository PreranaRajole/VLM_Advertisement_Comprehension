Performance is answering 50,000 questions a day. High performance is doing it for New Yorkers.

High performance. Delivered.

With more than 50,000 calls a day coming in from people speaking 170 different languages, New York City needed a way to field a constant stream of non-emergency phone requests. We helped the city develop 311, a 24/7 phone and online customer service center that provides nearly 4,000 services to free up resources and provide faster customer response times. 125 million calls later, the city is performing better than ever. That's high performance, delivered.
